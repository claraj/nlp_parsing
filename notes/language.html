  <dt>INTRODUCTION
    </dt><dd>While artificial languages (like programming languages) and natural
	languages share features of organization and structure, natural languages
	contain far more variety and many more exceptions. Nonetheless, we can
	apply ideas of parsing derived from computing to sentences in natural
	languages such as English.
	<p>
	The goal here is to use augmented transition networks to parse a limited
	range of declarative English sentences, based on the lexicon and other
	tables in our text.
    <p>

  </p></p></dd><dt>THE PROJECT
	</dt><dd>Write and test a program that reads declarative English sentences
	and produces LISP-like parses of those sentences.
	The sentences will consist of a noun phrase (subject), a verb phrase,
	and any of: noun phrases for direct and indirect objects, adjectives,
	adverbs, and prepositional phrases, as in the examples in class.
	<p>
	The vocabulary in your sentences need not be any larger than in the
	text&#39;s tables, though you can extend that lexicon if you like.
	Parse the sentences with augmented transition networks.
	<p>
	
  </p></p></dd><dt>EXAMPLE
	</dt><dd>A run of the program might look like this:
		<big><pre>
		
		Enter a sentence: Alice gave Bob a picture of the boat.
		
		(S (MOOD declarative)
		   (SUBJ (NP (NAME Alice)
		             (NUM 3s)))
		   (VERB (V (VERB give)
		            (TENSE past)
		            (NUM 3s)))
		   (IND-OBJ (NP (NAME Bob)
		                (NUM 3s)))
		   (OBJ (NP (DET a)
		            (NOUN picture)
                            (NUM 3s))
                            (MODS (PP (PREP of)
			              (OBJ (NP (DET the)
		                           (NOUN boat)
		                           (NUM 3s)))))))

  </dd><dt>WHAT TO UPLOAD
    </dt><dd>Upload a paper briefly describing your program and showing
	demonstrations of its behavior on a variety of sentences.
	Append the program&#39;s code or link to it.
